Flight Reservation System is based on a concept of booking and canceling flight reservations. 
Here, the system contains no login feature. The users can easily book flights,

This mini project contains fewer features but the essential ones:

5.	Check Tickets

Talking about the features of Flight Reservation System, for a flight reservation the user has to select whether  
he/she want domestic or international and date of journey. 
Then the system displays the city and the countries name and the user has to provide Source and Destination. 
After this, the system checks whether the flight is available or not, 
if it’s available then the system displays Airlines list with Departure and Arrival time, Price and Category. 
The system asks for the passenger’s information such as name, contact details, gender, email id. 

At last, for the payment process, the user has to select whether to pay from Debit, Credit or Net bankings. 
After all these procedures, reservations are made.
As a reservation proof, the system provides PNR, Flight, Passenger’s name, DOJ, Departure, and Arrival Time.  
In order to check tickets, the user has to provide PNR no. 
then only the system check for the respective tickets in the database and displays a result. 
Canceling a flight reservation is easy through the system, the user just has to provide their PNR number. 
The system asks for confirmation before canceling and also refunds some amount.
